- demo 3 https://jackdougherty.github.io/highcharts-with-google-sheets/bubble3.html
- Google Sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wh6nYrlou3VS2UMgP6wGrRl-bkB2UpY_g3gxqYYkgVw/edit#gid=0

- instructions:
 - in the first tab of a published Google Sheet, the first three columns must be labeled x, y, z and contain numeric data, followed by any additional columns
 - paste the googleSpreadsheetKey into the code, and modify other items mentioned in code comments
 - bubble size is automatically determined by the data range in column z
 - the only way to make the bubbles semi-transparent is specify the colors in rgba() model. fillOpacity does not work and nothing else works
